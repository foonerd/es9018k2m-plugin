  "PREREQUISITES": "Setup Requirements",
  "PREREQUISITES_DESC": "This plugin requires the i2s-dac overlay to be configured in Volumio.",
  "PREREQ_NOTICE": "Before using this plugin: Go to Volumio Settings > Playback Options > I2S DAC and select 'i2s-dac' (or 'Generic I2S DAC'), then Save and Reboot. The plugin will not detect your DAC until this is configured.",

  "DEVICE_FOUND": "ES9018K2M detected and ready",
  "DEVICE_NOT_FOUND": "ES9018K2M not detected. Check I2C connection and address. Ensure i2s-dac is selected in Volumio Playback Options and system has been rebooted.",
  "DEVICE_RESET": "Device reset to factory defaults",

  "FIR_DESC": "Finite Impulse Response filter shape. Fast roll-off is default. Minimum phase may reduce pre-ringing.",
  "IIR_FILTER": "IIR Bandwidth",
  "IIR_DESC": "Infinite Impulse Response filter bandwidth. Use 47K for PCM audio, higher values for DSD content.",
